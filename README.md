# Birthday
 Check upcoming birthdays and be a good friend!

# Hello to whoever is checking my work!
 Hope you have a good rest of your 24 hours! <br>
 I was unable to submit the folder into coursemology because it only accpeted files <br>
 So please download my homework from here :)

# Functionalities
 Home page shows the date, and current birthdays <br>
 Scroll down to see notes you've written about them, as well as upcoming birthdays <br>
 <br> 
 View Birthdays will show you a table of everyone and their birthdays (that you have uploaded of course)<br>
 Click on a table row to edit the data<br>
 <br>
 Add Profile lets you add a new entry into the database :) <br>
 <br>
 Actual Homework tab is an extremely low effort ditch in order to incoporate all functionalities into the website<br>
 The python file used is called helper.py, or you could go to the folder March holi hw for a slightly worse file if you want to grade it <br>

# Side note
 I did not test out edge cases cause I'm tired <br>
 Also if you're born on the 29th of Feb, the website won't show your upcoming birthday unless it is a leap year, sorry 'bout that<br>
 Also there's an extremely long-winded and guessy ctf in here if anyone interested :) <br>
 I spent way more than the recommended time on this :( <br>
